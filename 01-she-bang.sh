#!/bin/bash

#! is called she-bang
# 1. It is used to denote the path of interpreter (Interpreter is the one which executes the given order), & executes all the
# commands in the file/scripts using the interpreter
# 2. It has to be in the line number 1.
# 3. Adding more she-bangs in the next lines will not have any impact

#All the lines above this with the #Hash are comments just like in feature files
#1. Comments are used for adding description for the code, like why you added x, for future reference
#2. Commented lines are ignored when the script is run. Ignored by the interpreter.
